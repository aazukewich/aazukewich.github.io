          <p>Since childhood Aaron Z has had an undeniable passion for discovery, creativity, and sound. Manifest as a love of composing, his jazz-rooted compositions incorporate a myriad of sounds, combining elements of World Music, Classical, Rock, and Pop, in coherent, fascinating and beautiful ways. Performing these compositions, Aaron delivers the ultimate expression of his passion, emotion and joy.</p>

          <p>His first contact with jazz came early in life - records such as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, Herbie Hancock's Dis Is da Drum, and the Shuffle Demons Streetnix were frequently heard at home. Playing sax in his highschool jazz band he discovered the incredible freedom in jazz music - through melodic improvisation and a boundless pallet of harmonic colours. Aaron went on to study jazz performance at Toronto's York University, where his primary influence was Canadian saxophonist Mike Murley. Studying with Murley instilled in him a high regard for melody and lyricism in his improvisation and composition. While at York he also studied with saxophonist Kelly Jefferson, trumpeter Kevin Turcotte, and guitarist Lorne Lofsky. Aaron's love of composition and harmony drew him to the piano as his main musical voice, and he has taken lessons with award-winning pianist and composer Adrean Farrugia. </p>

          <!--
          <p>He draws inspiration not only from those great pianists that have influenced generations before him, such as Keith Jarrett, Herbie Hancock, and Brad Mehldau; but also from the younger generation of pianists including Robert Glasper, Kris Bowers and Gerald Clayton. His compositions incorporate unique combinations of rhythm, harmony and melody, influenced by the late Esbjorn Svensson Trio, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Avashai Cohen, and many others. The Aaron Z trio frequently debuts his compositions at Hamilton's Artword Artbar. His trio features local musicians including Joel Haynes, Ken McDonald, Joel Banks and Jim Slominski. His piano/bass duo Dually Noted has a Saturday residence at The Host restaurant in Port Dalhousie going on four years,  and was voted Niagara's jazz group of the year for 2013. In early 2014 Aaron was excited and honored to be a part of the emerging artist series at Toronto's Jazz Bistro.</p>
